# DOB Permit Viewer

## This is a site for viewing permits!

Here I use the data from `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rbx6-tga4` to construct a table that spits out permit information in a more readable format.


### Feature List:

- Search
- Filtered Search
- Light/Dark Mode
- Multiple ways to view dates
- Borough, Block and Lot to Address
- Address Visualization
- Exporting data as a .csv file
- Sort data by ascending or descending 


### Please check the issues tab for any known bugs as well as the state of the features listed
If there is no issue with a feature then it should be performing as expected.
