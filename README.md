# DOB Permit Viewer

## This is a site for viewing permits!

Here I use `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/rbx6-tga4`'s data to construct a table that spits out permit information for your viewing pleasure.
### Feature List:

- Search
- Filtered Search
- Light/Dark Mode
- Multiple ways to view dates
- Borough, Block and Lot to Address
- Address Visualization
- Exporting data as a .csv file
- Sort data by ascending or descending 

### Please check the issues tab for any known bugs as well as the state of the features listed
If there is no issue with a feature then it is performing as advertised.
